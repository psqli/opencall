The Opencall Project

	Overview

Opencall is a distributed audio-only chat for peer-to-peer comunication via
terminal. It works pretty much like a telephone, where someone calls its target,
expects to be answered, and from there starts communicating. There isn't a
central server where users willing to communicate will connect to, so it makes a
good fit for secure communication.

	How does it differ from the other applications out there providing the
	same functionality?

Simplicity. It's expected that the simplicity in its design will make it
different. In addition, it will also be very nice to talk to a friend of yours
via the terminal of your choice, won't it?

	How does the communication happen internally?

Let's say user A wants to communicate user B.
1) user A calls user B via its domain name or IP.
2) user B either accepts or rejects the connection coming from user A.
3) If user B accepted, then both will be able to speak and listen simultaneously
like in a real conversion.

That being said, the application from each user works both like a client and a
server.

	By the way...

If you are looking for an application with video call and/or file sharing
features, sorry but you will have to find it at somewhere else.
